Random Message Generator 
  This project is my first portfolio project and was made to help me develop my ability to code in Javascript
Features:
  1. Artistic ASCII Graphic
    - Currently there are 3 ASCII elements incoporated in this code to give a better fortune telling experience.
  2. Random Zodiac Sign Generator
    -The generateSign function randomly selects a zodiac sign from an array to personalize the fortune.
  3. Random Zodiac Sign Generator
    -The generateFate function randomly selects a fate from an array to personalize the fortune.
  4. Random Number Generator
    -The generateRandomNumber function generates a random index based on the length of a given array.
  5.Zoltar Decision Generator
    -This function combines the use of the randomSign and randomFate function to generate ZOlatrs final message to the user
  6.Personalized Fortune Display
    -The getPersonalFortune function takes a user's name as input, It prints some of the ASCII art and then generates zolatrs final decision
Future of Project
  Currently this project is very basic because with my current skill level this is all I can do in javascript. I am going to learn how to integrate Javascript with websites nd turn this into a website. I also plan on learning how to integrate chatgpt to generate more unique responses and have conversations with the user. I plan on also integrating a text to ascii conversion so all of Zoltar's responses will be in ASCII text creating a more coherant user experience
